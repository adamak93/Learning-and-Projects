Last bit of research for today before I kick things into high gear tomorrow. I think i have an idea of what to build, as the React Admin stuff I build will prove useful for future projects I wish to work on. After all, I'd be building a foundation that these ideas can be overlaid on top of for any project I wish to build that requires some level of data analysis. It could even be a great way to build out a way to track freelance clients by building out a CRM out of it. I still have a few other project ideas kicking around but I imagine all this needs is a fair amount of dedication to get it done even if all I'm doing is building it out of a tutorial. The documentation has more information I can take advantage of to extend that functionality even further based on who or what I'm building out a React Admin dashboard for. 

Till next time, hopefully to work:
