# January 10th, 2023

So let's revisit that todo list from yesterday.

1. Refresh Github Token for Gitmailer (DONE)
2. Fix issues with Gitmailer crashing on railway.
	1. Potential Culprit 1: Probably isn't looping properly, hence why it crashes. (YEP, concurrent connection issues.)
	2. Potential Culprit 2: Maybe changes I made between Gitmailer on this repo and the separate one I made for it didn't properly carry over. Could be that too?(nope.)
	3. Potential Culprit 3: WSL issues? (NOPE)
3. Continue working on React-Admin. (in progress)
4. Bring back trello board. (DONE)
5. Fix my sleep habits.  (IN PROGRESS)

Seems like most of my issues are  regarding concurrent connection issues. Let that be a lesson for me to decide when I say something is "done" cause apparently there's a lot more stuff I needed to do. Will update this space more tomorrow, need more sleep.
