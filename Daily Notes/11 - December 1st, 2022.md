I got the project done and in record time! I had to do a little trickery to figure out how to not get it to send failure emails but it seems to work pretty well! I adjusted the timing of the cron scheduler so it best fits the schedule I wish to follow. I'll still make daily commits, only that I'll be a bit more judicious in how i work and for how long.

And hopefully with less last minute epiphanies. The emails send properly but I figured this out all too soon to the deadline I set. Even if I did meet it, it was too close for comfort. Next time I'll have to be very mindful of how long I work, the deadlines I set, and how I accrue information. This could've been done a lot sooner. Even so, I'm happy for me in getting this done. Turns out I know a lot more than I give myself credit for. Onto the next (and probably hosting it. that too.)
