So the project I was thinking about doing is canceled. It's gone, reduced to nothing but ashes all because the idea of doing it sounded incredibly boring and I wanted to do something that wasn't going to make my eyes roll to the back of my skull. Melodramatic descriptions aside, I'm starting to think (IE: I just so happened to remember) that the whole point of this entire repo was to experiment with stuff and kinda just... play around. That means getting my hands dirty with technologies I read/hear about to build all kinds of stuff to learn and have some fun.

Up until this point, I've been looking at mostly front-end related stuff and I think now's the time to start branching deeper and deeper into back-end related projects like building out databases and working with APIs and stuff like that. There'd still be some front-end work to do but I think adding a few of these kind of projects would be a great way to start entrenching those skills deeper and deeper beyond "Occasional curiosity."

Currently torn between a movie website project or integrating Supabase into AdamantAdmin but we'll see how it goes. Maybe a fork would work better for Adamantadmin? Not sure yet. Maybe might need a break from AdamantAdmin. Could go for some fun.

Till next time,

-Adam.
