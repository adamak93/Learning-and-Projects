# November 24th, 2022

Didn't do much today. Slow day but I'm here and I'm making my commit for the day as insignificant as it might be. Got lost in a few things and just didn't feel the motivation. Didn't sleep well either and pushing myself through it felt like a slog. I spent most of today doing more research on Nodemailer itself and setting my dev environment up on my Mac, away from the office if need be. The process seems more streamlined than I remember it but my Mac is in dire need of updates and maybe even a full system wipe at some point. Beyond that, I didn't get to write code and I'm feeling some kind of way about it.

With the rules I set for this project and how the email notifier itself work is supposed to work, it would have sent an email regarding no commits being made as I complete this journal entry for the day near 1AM. I'm not discouraged and I'll have to enforce some structure around building and strengthening this habit. I've given myself a deadline to turn this in; December 2nd. (IE: Next Friday). If I had to say what stage of development I'm in, I'd say I'm  past preliminary analysis and into the development process but I'll have to do some more development to make that matter.

I should definitely look into Obsidian add-ons that allow me to build Jira/Trello-style Kanban boards, I bet that'd help a lot.
