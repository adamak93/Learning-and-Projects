Hello hello, goodbye and hello again. It's been some time, I needed to duck away from this for a while to take care of some things with stream stuff that I started a while ago. Plus, it was the holidays & with family over and being away from my computer I figured a winter break of sorts was inevitable and probably needed so I can better sort out other things too.

So let's catalogue things in a To-Do List of sorts:

1. Refresh Github Token for Gitmailer
2. Fix issues with Gitmailer crashing on railway.
	1. Potential Culprit 1: Probably isn't looping properly, hence why it crashes.
	2. Potential Culprit 2: Maybe changes I made between Gitmailer on this repo and the separate one I made for it didn't properly carry over. Could be that too?
	3. Potential Culprit 3: WSL issues?
3. Continue working on React-Admin.
4. Bring back trello board.
5. Fix my sleep habits.

Mission's clear, need to get to work.

UPDATE: I don't think I handled my errors and exceptions at all.  Hence the crashes and lack of information from railway, so some errorhandling/exception code is warranted. Could also try it again on another platform or just run the whole thing locally on my machine before midnight, dunno yet. exploring other solutions.
