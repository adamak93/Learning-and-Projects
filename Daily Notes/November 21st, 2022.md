Okay, day one of all this. Whole point of this entire initiative of mine is to make sure I'm actually good at documenting the whole process of what I learn, how i figure it out, and what I build over time, including code commits.  Admittedly it's a little strange for me to journal somewhere that isn't a bullet journal, but I'll deal. Different problems require different solutions and tools to approach them with.

Speaking of problems, I'm starting small with an email notifier that sends an email if I didn't make a commit to GitHub so I'm looking through stuff that allows me to send emails using like, Node.JS or something. I found a few things, but I'm gonna add them to the "Problems to Solve" folder and *maybe* my tutorial folder.

I spent most of today just building out my developer environment on my computer, and on my Desktop no less! I have a few notes from my job as to how i set up my whole React/JS environment and I've just been going through that to build things out. I'll probably add something to the Knowledge file too for that, so stuff like what I installed, VSCode Extensions, etc. Maybe i'll do something with my laptop. Not sure yet, but thank God for Settings Sync to make that easier.

I'll continue working on research tomorrow. I've got a couple tabs set aside on Edge for me to add to the relevant files and folders.
