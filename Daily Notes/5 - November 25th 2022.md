Today wasn't the best of days. Spent more time reading over things but not focusing much on working on things. I don't have too much to commit if at all and what I have doesn't feel substantial, if at all. I haven't been sleeping well nor have I been taking care of myself so I might take the weekend to recover and get my bearings back. This entry will be a little shorter but if I can at least get that temporary email working, I think I'm good. I might register on outlook just to make it slightly easier on myself so I don't have to deal with Gmail being weird.

If anything else got done, I have my macOS setup working again after a couple hours of updates and brew updates and I downloaded Obsidian to it too, so that was fun. I forgot how much I prefer using my Mac as a development machine but really, anything works. The tools matter less than the person who uses them and I like to think I'm flexible using whatever I can get my hands on.
