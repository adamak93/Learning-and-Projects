Got to talk with my dad today over the phone and despite being a bit late to it, we covered a lot of stuff during our hour long call that's stuck a lot of ideas in the back of my head. React Admin and Supabase are two things he mentioned I should take a look at but without a project in mind, these things seem less useful in a vacuum. Supabase is a Firebase alternative of sorts I could probably stand to use for another project and React Admin is an admin panel you can use to make CRMs and things like that. I've got a few ideas for both but I don't like the idea of just obsessively learning new things without something to hone them through. I've added their pages to my knowledge folder just as a way to keep something I can use to refer back to should the need to make something out of either of these (or both you never know) takes my fancy.

Hasn't been the most productive of weekends and I haven't submitted a commit today but if I can at least get these journal entries together, I should be OK in laying down a foundation for relative consistency. I always struggled with routine and structure and admitting I have a problem with this is the first step toward a solution. One doesn't become stronger if they don't identify their weaknesses, right?
