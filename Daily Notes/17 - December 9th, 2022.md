Missed a commit, guess my six days a week routine is going to have to be backfilled for tomorrow just to keep the momentum going. Yesterday was a busy day without wishing to get into the reasons why I skipped committing but I'm left with more questions than answers the more I reflect upon a few things.

I think I need to set a quota as to what commits I'm doing, what folders, and frequency of commits. That and set a more stringent schedule around when I'm getting commits done. It's likely that I need to set the CRON timer to about 18:00 to enforce a 9-5 esque schedule I can work with more effectively. I'm also at something of a fork in the road regarding what the next step is and my end goals. I think the end goal by the end of all this is to feel more confident in being able to contribute to open source projects more readily. It's more of a mindest shift at this point, being able to deflate some of the pressure I perceive that comes with open source contributions and making it more routine of an occurence. This might be the next thing I do in the next couple projects, but I want to ramp up the pace by which I keep working on projects so I get more done in a shorter amount of time.

I guess I'm just braindumping at this point, but maybe posting all this is what I need to figure out what I can do next.
