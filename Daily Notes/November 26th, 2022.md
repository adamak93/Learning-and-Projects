# November 26th, 2022

No commits today, just spent tonight with my friends and most of the day cleaning things up around the house and in the office to clear my mind and correct my habits a bit. All things considered, I think I needed the break and the rest. I've been feeling more burned out, not from this commitment towards daily commits but just in the way I haven't been treating myself kindly lately. Be it a lack of sleep or not eating properly, it's clear that I haven't been at my best state but getting to see my friends and lay back a bit has definitely helped. 

Tomorrow I'll be speaking with my dad, I'll spend more time doing research so I'm pushing my project back to "Preliminary Analysis" until Monday. I think I need to spend more time looking into how the timing itself works and how to get a node app to recognize when to fire functions.
