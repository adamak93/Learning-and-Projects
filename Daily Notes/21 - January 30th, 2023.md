So I wrapped up the react admin stuff a bit ago and when it comes to what I've been building, I need to shake things up a bit because I'm getting rather bored with what I've been working on. I've also caused some issues with my Gitmailer project in trying to get it hosted somewhere and it's definitely made me frustrated enough to give up, however momentarily it's been.  Even so, i've made changes wherever I could and it seems to be working again, so now's the best time to start laying down new ground rules for what my commits should look like, how long projects should ideally take, and when it's a good idea to just... stop and move on.

+ Commits should ideally be more than tiny text alterations. They need to be substantial additions, so they can't just be refactoring, indentation, tweaks, and re-formatting as the only work of the day. This also extends to resarch and time taken to find new projects to work on.
+ Projects need to have a pre-defined deadline; up to two weeks at most. Ideally the shorter the project, the better so you can move to the next one even faster. 
+ Commit-check days are Monday-Friday. (Monday-Saturday pushed it a bit too far, so this change would allow for some flexibility if i wanted to work weekends so i'd actually want to do so on my own volition)
+ Code for no less than 30 minutes a day, and aim to exceed even that.
+ Balance the time taken to code with finding new projects to work on and new skills to explore and ensured they are varied enough. (Experimentation + variety can go a long way in encouraging constant coding)
	+ Explore diffrent programming languages. EG: Take two weeks to do a python project as an example.
