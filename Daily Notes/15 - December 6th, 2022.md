Still doing more research , now just trying to wrap my head around how I can scaffold React Admin around ideas I may have but all I've been doing is reading documentation and the youtube video I linked. I have a couple ideas for projects I want to work on with other people too, but I'm also thinking of other kinds of projects I can do to focus on skills I'm lacking on. There was a video I posted in this folder that links to 4 modern react apps I can build and it's giving me some ideas, but nothing solid just yet.

Still need to rerail my focus a bit. I'm also trying to figure out more about what Obsidian can do, referring to the community of what kind of extensions and stuff I can make use of. So many questions, so much information, and all during a pretty pressing time. Things will work themselves out. I know they will.
