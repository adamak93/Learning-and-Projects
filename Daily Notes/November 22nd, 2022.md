Another day, more research done; feeling pretty good about where this is headed so far as I've spent some time breaking the problems down into separate chunks. There's three or four unique problems I need to look into and I'm more than comfortable with saying I'm ready to start development soon. Most likely by tomorrow. My goals for then are to just build something small and deploy it live so I can ensure it works properly and bolt additional functionality from there.

As far as where to start; I can start with getting Nodemailer to send an email to my personal email from a fresh email I'll make in Gmail and I'll create a separate function that'll print to the console or wherever I need to so I can make sure the timer itself works.

Insofar as Github API stuff is concerned; that might be the very last piece of the puzzle that I'll figure out. I'd rather break this down as its own separate thing so as to not get overwhelmed. I'll save my work for this it in its own special folder on my computer, saving it as a private repo so as to ensure that no one else except myself gets access to it. I need to be better at chunking these problems into their own thing and work on them bit by bit.

I'll commit these changes and work on this tomorrow. Feeling good so far.
