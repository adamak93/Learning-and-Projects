I spent some more time today looking through YouTube videos on Nodemailer and getting a teeny-tiny rudimentary version of the mailer functionality working but a lot of where I'm having trouble understanding things is how the Git API works in conjunction with Octokit. As far as I know I think I just need to get the commits by repo and then measure against the current time but whatever I'm coming up with and the things I'm finding don't feel like they're putting mecloser to a solution. There's also the teeny tiny problem of not sleeping particularly well so I'm probably smashing my head against a wall repeatedly.

I'll continue more of this tomorrow when I get my 40 winks.
