A little more progress was made today; I managed to build out the Nodemailer and NodeCron functionality so it runs every 24 hours, and I got everything working with env files (which I added to my gitignore bc thank god i did). When all that was done, I got a very VERY rough Octokit api call working. It's calling the login but I need to get a specific repo and check to see how many hours its been within the last commit, that way I can run the conditional to send the email or not.

I can feel this being done faster but we'll see if I can get it done by Friday. Fingers crossed! Till then I did a damn good job.
