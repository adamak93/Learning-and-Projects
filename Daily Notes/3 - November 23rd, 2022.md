Alright, work starts now. I made a small Node server app... thing to check that I can print something small to the browser, whereupon I can check that using VSCode's debug tools and things *seem* to check out. I can use that to bootstrap a quick and dirty node app and see if I can just start by sending an email to an account. I just need to start by getting some tempemails working and then I can start from there. Most of my time today was spent just going over my resources, scaffolding a plan of attack to handle each different problem on its own. I also wrapped up a blog post for an unrelated hustle of mine that I've been meaning to do and concluded with some streaming.

Kinda hope there's a way for me to just build this stuff out on my stream, hopefully that'll work itself out somehow. Till then, I just wanna start building this project out.
