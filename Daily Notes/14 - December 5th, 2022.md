# December 5th, 2022

Hasn't been *too* eventful of a day: Mostly did a lot of research into the next project I want to build and made a teeny tiny mockup of a kanban board I'll likely import into Trello. Not sure where this will go from here but this will be fleshed out as the days go on. React Admin is probably the next thing I'll build and I'm still compiling resources for that. I figure it'll be a good exercise of my React skills, especially since the stuff I found makes use of Material UI. As far as preliminary analysis goes at the beginning of the week is concerned, it seems to be going well. 

I took yesterday off and I think I'm nailing down a six-day/week schedule so I can get commits, research,  and progress done on projects. That way I at least have something to work with. I also edited my project to console log and send me a CC of the email that gets sent to whoever the Gitmailer app sends an email to. I'll likely come up with documentation for it and open source it. Could be fun to do.
