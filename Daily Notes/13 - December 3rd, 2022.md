Spent some time going through a few alternatives for hosting, the thing works but the email won't fire for today and tomorrow: it's designed to not cover the weekends. I found a few great alternatives and the one I'm looking at has seamless integration with github repos. I also put together a small project tracking template on trello so I think it'll work to track future ideas.

Small update, may have more tomorrow. just doing this to keep the habit of daily commits up.  Till next time.
