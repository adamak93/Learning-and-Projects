Today, I'm back on the saddle. Beyond the journal entries and knowledge entries that I've added, I'm adding some info related to CRON jobs. From my understanding, cron is a command-line utility that schedules jobs on unix based operating systems and Node has a cron package called node-cron (obviously). It seems that it's possible to automate Nodemailer using node-cro but the github api stuff is a tale for another time. As long as I can nail down the nodemailer functionality, I should be golden. And just like that, we're back to "In Development". Funny what catching up on sleep can do for a perpetually sleep-deprived guy.

Time to get more stuff done.
